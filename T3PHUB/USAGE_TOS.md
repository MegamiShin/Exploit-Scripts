Hi!
I'm glad you're interested in learning from T3PHUB.
Please follow these guidelines if you wish to use the T3PHUB source code:

1) You may not claim the source code as your own.
2) Wanna learn from the source code? Great! I'm happy to hear that, you can do practically anything with the source code, test it, edit it, etc, but you may not:
2.1) Republish it without credits, you are welcome to put this on your repo, but always you have to make it **CLEAR** that it wasn't made by you.
2.2) Republish it obfuscated, or in an otherwise unreadable form.
2.3) Use it for any illegal purposes
